# Home Assignment 3 - Data visualization App

## Description
This is the third bonus point homework assignment. It is a data visualisation app with
focus on user interface design, LINQ and SOLID principles. 

## Scenario
Imagine you are working in the IT department of a data analysis company. The Sales
department requests an application that helps visualize data for better analysis. The
application must provide clear, intuitive, and visually appealing charts so that
managers can present insights to stakeholders and non-technical teams.
The application should be flexible and customizable- users must be able to add and
remove graphs easily to adjust the displayed data as needed.
